CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findamr_v4_msgs_srvs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "amr_v4_msgs_srvs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "amr_v4_msgs_srvs"
  with any of the following names:

    amr_v4_msgs_srvsConfig.cmake
    amr_v4_msgs_srvs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "amr_v4_msgs_srvs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "amr_v4_msgs_srvs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "amr_v4_msgs_srvs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
